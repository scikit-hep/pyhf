3. Commit your changes to a feature branch of your fork push to your branch
4. Test your changes with `pytest`
5. Update your fork to make sure your changes don't conflict with the current state of the master branch

## Bug Reports

If you have found a bug please report it by filling out the [bug report template](https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyhf/issues/new?template=Bug-Report.md&labels=bug&title=Bug+Report+:+Title+Here).

## Installing the development environment

We recommend first reading the "[Developing](https://scikit-hep.org/pyhf/development.html)" page on the pyhf website and the coming back here.

You can install the development environment (which includes a number of extra) libraries and all others needed to run the tests via `pip`:

```
python -m pip install --ignore-installed -U -e .[complete]
```

To make the PR process much smoother we also strongly recommend that you setup the Git pre-commit hook for [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) by running

```
pre-commit install
```

This will run `black` over your code each time you attempt to make a commit and warn you if there is an error, canceling the commit.

## Running the tests

You can run the unit tests (which should be fast!) via the following command.

```
python -m pytest --ignore=tests/test_notebooks.py
```

Note: This ignores the notebook tests (which are run via [papermill](https://github.com/nteract/papermill) which run somewhat slow.
Make sure to run the complete suite before submitting a PR

```
python -m pytest
```

## Making a pull request

We try to follow [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages and PR titles. Since we merge PR's using squash commits, it's fine if the final commit messages (proposed in the PR body) follow this convention.

## Generating Reference Visuals

New baseline visuals can be generated using this command:

```
python -m pytest tests/contrib/test_viz.py --mpl-generate-path=tests/contrib/baseline
```

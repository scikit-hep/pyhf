Talks
=====

We are always interested in talking about :code:`pyhf`. See the abstract and a list of previously given presentations and feel free to invite us to your next conference/workshop/meeting!

Abstract
--------

    The HistFactory p.d.f. template `[CERN-OPEN-2012-016]
    <https://cds.cern.ch/record/1456844>`_ is per-se independent of its
    implementation in ROOT and it is useful to be able to run statistical
    analysis outside of the ROOT, RooFit, RooStats framework. pyhf is a
    pure-python implementation of that statistical model for multi-bin
    histogram-based analysis and its interval estimation is based on the
    asymptotic formulas of "Asymptotic formulae for likelihood-based tests of
    new physics" `[arxiv:1007.1727] <https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1727>`_.  pyhf
    supports modern computational graph libraries such as TensorFlow and
    PyTorch in order to make use of features such as auto-differentiation and
    GPU acceleration.

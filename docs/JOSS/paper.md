# Summary

Measurements in High Energy Physics (HEP) rely on determining the compatibility of observed collision events with theoretical predictions.
The relationship between them is often formalised in a statistical model $f(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{\phi})$ describing the probability of data $\mathbf{x}$ given model parameters $\mathbf{\phi}$.
Given observed data, the likelihood $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{\phi})$ then serves as the basis to test hypotheses on the parameters $\mathbf{\phi}$.
For measurements based on binned data (histograms), the `HistFactory` family of statistical models [@Cranmer:1456844] has been widely used in both Standard Model measurements [@HIGG-2013-02] as well as searches for new physics [@ATLAS-CONF-2018-041].
`pyhf` implements a declarative, plain-text format for describing `HistFactory`-based likelihoods that is targeted for reinterpretation and long-term preservation in analysis data repositories such as HEPData [@Maguire:2017ypu].

Through adoption of open source "tensor" computational Python libraries, `pyhf` decreases the abstractions between a physicist performing an analysis and the statistical modeling without sacrificing computational speed.
By taking advantage of tensor calculations, `pyhf` outperforms the traditional `C++` implementation of `HistFactory` on data from real LHC analyses.
`pyhf`'s default computational backend is built from NumPy and SciPy, and supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX as alternative backend choices.
These alternative backends support hardware acceleration on GPUs, and in the case of JAX JIT compilation, as well as auto-differentiation allowing for calculating the full gradient of the likelihood function &mdash; all contributing to speeding up fits.

## Impact on Physics

In addition to enabling the first publication of full likelihoods by an LHC experiment [@ATL-PHYS-PUB-2019-029], `pyhf` has been used by the `SModels` library to improve the reinterpretation of results of searches for new physics at LHC experiments [@Abdallah:2020pec], [@Khosa:2020zar], [@Alguero:2020grj].

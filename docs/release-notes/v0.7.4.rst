|release v0.7.4|_
=================

This is a patch release from ``v0.7.3`` â†’ ``v0.7.4``.

Fixes
-----

* Skip callbacks with dead weakrefs while iterating over callbacks in ``pyhf``
  events, like :func:`pyhf.set_backend`, to avoid the possibility of accessing
  dead weakrefs before they could be garbage collected.
  (PR :pr:`2310`)

  The fixed bug was subtle and occurred nondeterministically when the
  :class:`pyhf.tensorlib` was changed repeatedly causing dead weakrefs
  to be accessed before Python's garbage collection could remove them.
  Most users should be unaffected.

Contributors

``v0.7.4`` benefited from contributions from:

* Daniel Werner

|release v0.6.0|_
=================

This is a minor release from ``v0.5.4`` → ``v0.6.0``.

Important Notes
---------------

* Please note this release has **API breaking changes** and carefully read these
  notes while updating your code to the ``v0.6.0`` API.
  Perhaps most relevant is the changes to the :func:`pyhf.infer.hypotest` API, which now
  uses a ``calctype`` argument to differentiate between using an asymptotic calculator
  or a toy calculator, and a ``test_stat`` kwarg to specify which test statistic
  the calculator should use, with ``'qtilde'``, corresponding to
  :func:`pyhf.infer.test_statistics.qmu_tilde`, now the default option.
  It also relies more heavily on using kwargs to pass options through to the optimizer.
* Following the recommendations of |NEP 29|_ ``pyhf`` ``v0.6.0`` drops support for
  Python 3.6.
  |PEP 494|_ also notes that Python 3.6 will be end of life in December 2021, so
  ``pyhf`` is moving forward with a minimum required runtime of Python 3.7.
* Support for the discovery test statistic, :math:`q_{0}`, has now been added through
  the :func:`pyhf.infer.test_statistics.q0` API.
* Support for pseudoexperiments (toys) has been added through the
  :func:`pyhf.infer.calculators.ToyCalculator` API.
  Please see the corresponding `example notebook`_ for more detailed exploration
  of the API.
* The ``minuit`` extra, ``python -m pip install pyhf[minuit]``, now uses and requires
  the |iminuit docs|_ ``v2.X`` release series and API.
  Note that ``iminuit`` ``v2.X`` can result in slight differences in minimization
  results from ``iminuit`` ``v1.X``.
* The documentation will now be versioned with releases on ReadTheDocs.
  Please use `pyhf.readthedocs.io`_ to access the documentation for the latest
  stable release of ``pyhf``.
* ``pyhf`` is transtioning away from Stack Overflow to `GitHub Discussions`_ for
  resolving user questions not covered in the documentation.
  Please check the `GitHub Discussions`_ page to search for discussions addressing
  your questions and to open up a new discussion if your question is not covered.
* ``pyhf`` has published a paper in the Journal of Open Source Software. |JOSS DOI|
  Please make sure to include the paper reference in all citations of ``pyhf``, as
  documented in the `Use and Citations`_ section of the documentation.

Fixes
-----

* Fix bug where all extras triggered warning for installation of the ``contrib`` extra.
* ``float``-like values are used in division for :func:`pyhf.writexml`.
* ``Model.spec`` now supports building new models from existing models.
* :math:`p`-values are now reported based on their quantiles, instead of interpolating
  test statistics and converting to :math:`p`-values.
* Namespace collisions between ``uproot3`` and ``uproot``/``uproot4`` have been fixed
  for the ``xmlio`` extra.
* The ``normsys`` modifier now uses the :mod:`pyhf.interpolators.code4` interpolation
  method by default.
* The ``histosys`` modifier now uses the :mod:`pyhf.interpolators.code4p` interpolation
  method by default.

Features
--------

Python API
~~~~~~~~~~

* The ``tensorlib`` API now supports a ``tensorlib.to_numpy`` and
  ``tensorlib.ravel`` API.
* The :func:`pyhf.infer.calculators.ToyCalculator` API has been added to support
  pseudoexperiments (toys).
* The empirical test statistic distribution API has been added to help support the
  ``ToyCalculator`` API.
* Add a ``tolerance`` kwarg to the optimizer API to set a ``float`` value as a
  tolerance for termination of the fit.
* The :func:`pyhf.optimize.opt_minuit.minuit_optimizer` optimizer now can return
  correlations of the fitted parameters through use of the ``return_correlation``
  Boolean kwarg.
* Add the ``pyhf.utils.citation`` API to get a ``str`` of the preferred BibTeX entry
  for citation of the version of ``pyhf`` installed.
  See the example for the CLI API for more information.
* The :func:`pyhf.infer.hypotest` API now uses a ``calctype`` argument to differentiate
  between using an asymptotic calculator or a toy calculator, and a ``test_stat`` kwarg
  to specify which test statistic to use.
  It also relies more heavily on using kwargs to pass options through to the optimizer.
* The default ``test_stat`` kwarg for :func:`pyhf.infer.hypotest` and the calculator
  APIs is ``'qtilde'``, which corresponds to the alternative test statistic
  :func:`pyhf.infer.test_statistics.qmu_tilde`.
* The return type of :math:`p`-value like functions is now a 0-dimensional ``tensor``
  (with shape ``()``) instead of a ``float``.
  This is required to support end-to-end automatic differentiation in future releases.

CLI API
~~~~~~~

* The CLI API now supports a ``--citation`` or ``--cite`` option to print the
  preferred BibTeX entry for citation of the version of ``pyhf`` installed.

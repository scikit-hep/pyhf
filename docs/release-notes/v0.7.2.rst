|release v0.7.2|_
=================

This is a patch release from ``v0.7.1`` â†’ ``v0.7.2``.

Important Notes
---------------

* ``pyhf`` became a `NumFOCUS Affiliated Project
  <https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects/affiliated-projects>`__ on
  2022-12-19. |NumFOCUS Affiliated Project|
  ``v0.7.1`` is the first release to appear in a NumFOCUS Newsletter and
  ``v0.7.2`` is the first release to appear as part of the Affiliated Projects
  page.
  (PR :pr:`2179`)

Fixes
-----

* If a multiple component parameter of interest is used raise
  :class:`~pyhf.exceptions.InvalidModel`.
  This guards against modifiers like :class:`~pyhf.modifiers.shapefactor`,
  :class:`~pyhf.modifiers.shapesys`, and :class:`~pyhf.modifiers.staterror`
  from being used as POIs.
  (PR :pr:`2197`)
* Use :data:`typing.TYPE_CHECKING` guard to avoid causing a
  :class:`ModuleNotFoundError` when the version of NumPy installed is older
  than ``v1.21.0``, which is the first NumPy release to include
  :mod:`numpy.typing`.
  (PR :pr:`2208`)

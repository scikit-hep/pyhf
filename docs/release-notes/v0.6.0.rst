|release v0.6.0|_
=================

This is a minor release from ``v0.5.4`` â†’ ``v0.6.0``.

Important Notes
---------------

* Please note this release has **API breaking changes** and carefully read these
  notes while updating your code to the ``v0.6.0`` API.
  Perhaps most relevant is the changes to the |hypotest API|_ API now uses a
  ``test_stat`` kwarg to specify which test statistic to use and relies more
  heavily on using kwargs to pass options through to the optimizer.
* Support for the discovery test statistic, :math:`q_{0}`, has now been added through
  the |q0 API|_ API.
* toys
* new requirements for ``iminuit`` and ``uproot``
* Transitioning away from Stack Overflow to GitHub Discussions
* Versioned docs --- don't go to ``master`` docs unless you want unstable

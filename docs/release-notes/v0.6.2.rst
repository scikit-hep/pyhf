|release v0.6.2|_
=================

This is a patch release from ``v0.6.1`` â†’ ``v0.6.2``.

Important Notes
---------------

* Only lower bounds on core dependencies are now set.
  This allows for greater developer freedom and reduces the risk of breaking
  user's applications by unnecessarily constraining libraries.
  This also means that users will be responsible for ensuring that their
  installed dependencies do not conflict with or break ``pyhf``.
  c.f. Hynek Schlawack's blog post `Semantic Versioning Will Not Save You
  <https://hynek.me/articles/semver-will-not-save-you/>`_ for more in coverage
  on this topic.
  For most users nothing should change.
  This mainly affects developers of other libraries in which ``pyhf`` is a dependnecy.
  (PR :pr:`1382`)

Fixes
-----

* Allow for precision to be properly set for the tensorlib ``ones`` and ``zeros``
  methods through a ``dtype`` argument.
  This allows for precision to be properly set through the :func:`pyhf.set_backend`
  ``precision`` argument.
  (PR :pr:`1369`)
* The default precision for all backends is now ``64b``.
  (PR :pr:`1400`)
* Add check to ensure that POIs are not fixed during a fit.
  (PR :pr:`1409`)

Features
--------

CLI API
~~~~~~~

* The CLI API now supports a ``patchset inspect`` API to list the individual
  pathces in a ``PatchSet``.

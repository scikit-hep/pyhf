Roadmap (2019-2020)
===================

This is the pyhf 2019 into 2020 Roadmap (Issue
`#561 <https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyhf/issues/561>`__).

Overview and Goals
------------------

We will follow loosely Seibert’s `Heirarchy of
Needs <https://twitter.com/FRoscheck/status/1159158552298229763>`__

|Seibert Heirarchy of Needs SciPy 2019| (`Stan
Seibert <https://github.com/seibert>`__, SciPy 2019)

As a general overview that will include:

-  Improvements to docs

   -  Add lots of examples
   -  Add at least 5 well documented case studies

-  Issue cleanup
-  Adding core feature support
-  "pyhf evolution": integration with columnar data analysis systems
-  GPU support and testing
-  Publications

   -  Submit pyhf to JOSS
   -  Submit pyhf to pyOpenSci
   -  Start pyhf paper in 2020

-  Align with IRIS-HEP Analysis Systems NSF milestones

Time scale
----------

The roadmap will be executed over mostly Quarter 3 of 2019 through
Quarter 1 of 2020, with some projects continuing into Quarter 2 of 2020

-  2019-Q3

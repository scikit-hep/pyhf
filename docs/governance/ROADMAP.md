As a general overview that will include:

- Improvements to docs
   - Add lots of examples
   - Add at least 5 well documented case studies
- Issue cleanup
- Adding core feature support
- "pyhf evolution": integration with columnar data analysis systems
- GPU support and testing
- Publications
   - Submit pyhf to JOSS
   - Submit pyhf to pyOpenSci
   - Start pyhf paper in 2020
- Align with IRIS-HEP Analysis Systems NSF milestones

## Time scale

The roadmap will be executed over mostly Quarter 3 of 2019 through Quarter 1 of 2020, with some projects continuing into Quarter 2 of 2020

- 2019-Q3
- 2019-Q4

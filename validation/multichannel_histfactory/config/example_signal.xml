<!--
    Single channel configuration exampple.
    The top level configuration XML is example.xml

    NormalizedByTheory should be "True" (not "TRUE" or "true") for all non-data-driven backgrounds.

    If you comment or remove the <Data> tag then it will use the expected data.

    Histogram inputs should be in pb and in top-level xml the lumi should be in 1/pb
    (The important thing is that they match... fb and 1/fb is also ok)

    Note: Config.dtd needs to be accessible.  It can be found in ROOT release area.
    The file system path is relative to location of this XML file, not the executable.

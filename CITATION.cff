abstract: |
  The HistFactory p.d.f. template is per-se independent of its implementation
  in ROOT and it is useful to be able to run statistical analysis outside of
  the ROOT, RooFit, RooStats framework. pyhf is a pure-python implementation
  of that statistical model for multi-bin histogram-based analysis and its
  interval estimation is based on the asymptotic formulas of "Asymptotic
  formulae for likelihood-based tests of new physics". pyhf supports modern
  computational graph libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX in order
  to make use of features such as autodifferentiation and GPU acceleration.
